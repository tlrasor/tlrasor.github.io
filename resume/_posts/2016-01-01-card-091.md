I develop solutions for commercial banks forecasting cash inventory usage, assisting with workforce management, and legacy backend systems integration.

In health care, I have experience in patient matching and identity management, patient care facilitation, HL7 messaging systems integration, and patient database deduplication.

I also do full-stack web development designing and implementing internal and customer facing applications.
