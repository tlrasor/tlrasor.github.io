I am a good fit for a customer-centric organization that is passionate about embracing change and taking smart risks. I have been successful working in a cross-functional capacity interfacing with customers, data scientists, developers, and business analysts coordinating product research and development as well as providing technical leadership. I love learning new languages and ideas and enjoy sharing my enthusiasm with others.
