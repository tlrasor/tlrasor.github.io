I am passionate about working with customers and believe that shipping software with proven customer value is my first priority. I am experienced in research-oriented small-teams working together in a larger enterprise. I believe software development requires wearing many hats and I enjoy working in a cross-functional capacity. I am a good fit for a team that embraces change and smart risks. I love learning new languages and ideas and enjoy sharing my enthusiasm with others.
